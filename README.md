# byte_me
This is for the group with Lazaro, Jacob, and Raul
Our current workflow is that we work in our own local branches.

We will pull request for peer review between the 3 of us and review those changes during scheduled meetings. Each week we will talk over Discord to discuss progress and any development obstacles. Each member will push there own version and then we will all decide which version is the best. That version will be noted with the tag "Proj 3 Design and UI"

We will communicate all project updates via Discord, and if team is unable to communicate real-time, we will use Discord to communicate via offline messages. We will also use text messages and/or Canvas.

The team agreed to use the following package and class names to streamline our development. 

byteMe: //package

App.java //runs the UI

searchBar: //package

SearchBar.java //creates the search engine UI
BarTopPanel.java
BarCenterPanel.java
BarBottomPanel.java

adminMode: //package

AdminTopPanel.java
AdminCenterPanel.java
